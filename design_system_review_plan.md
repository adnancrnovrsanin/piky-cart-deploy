# PikyCart Design System Review Plan

## I. Information Gathering & Initial Analysis (Completed)
1.  Reviewed `constants/theme.ts` to understand the defined brand identity elements (colors, typography, spacing, border radii, shadows, predefined component styles).
2.  Reviewed `design/shopping-list-sharing.md` for specific feature design guidelines.
3.  Analyzed `components/LogoPlaceholder.tsx` for logo implementation.
4.  Analyzed `components/EmptyListState.tsx` for application state and component styling.
5.  Analyzed `app/dashboard.tsx` for a complex screen implementation, focusing on adherence to the theme in styles, colors, typography, and iconography.

## II. Comprehensive Audit & Evaluation (To Be Synthesized into Report)
1.  **Verify Consistent Brand Identity Implementation:**
    *   Cross-reference findings from all reviewed files against `constants/theme.ts`.
    *   Identify discrepancies in the use of `COLORS`, `FONTS`, `FONT_SIZES`, `SPACING`, `BORDER_RADIUS`, and `SHADOWS`.
2.  **Check Adherence to Design Principles:**
    *   **Effortless Convenience:** Assess if inconsistencies (e.g., mixed typography, unpredictable spacing) could lead to friction.
    *   **Tangible Savings:** Evaluate if `COLORS.accent` and other visual cues for savings are used consistently and prominently.
    *   **User Control:** Consider if deviations from a clear design system might make the interface feel less predictable or empowering.
    *   **Intelligent Simplicity:** Determine if visual inconsistencies add unnecessary complexity to the presentation of features.
3.  **Validate Against Target User Personas:**
    *   **Savvy Planner (Jess):** Does inconsistent typography or spacing impact information hierarchy?
    *   **Efficiency Optimizer (Alex):** Could visual inconsistencies or deviations from expected patterns slow down interaction or reduce aesthetic appeal?
4.  **Audit Specific Areas (based on findings):**
    *   **Color Usage:**
        *   Document use of hardcoded hex values vs. theme `COLORS`.
        *   Note any inconsistent use of primary/secondary/accent colors.
        *   Assess if chart colors align with or deviate from the brand palette.
    *   **Typography Hierarchy:**
        *   Highlight the use of different font families than defined in the theme.
        *   Document hardcoded font sizes vs. theme `FONT_SIZES`.
        *   Assess clarity of heading vs. body text distinctions.
    *   **Icon Consistency:**
        *   Check if icon colors are sourced from the theme or hardcoded.
        *   Note consistency in sizing and stroke weight.
    *   **Spacing System:**
        *   Identify hardcoded spacing values vs. theme `SPACING` constants.
        *   Evaluate adherence to the 8px baseline grid.
    *   **Border Radii Consistency:**
        *   Compare actual `borderRadius` usage against the 4px target and the theme's `BORDER_RADIUS` scale.
    *   **Logo Placement and Scaling:**
        *   Review logo implementation for adherence to brand.
5.  **Check Application States (based on findings):**
    *   **Loading States:** Check color consistency and implementation.
    *   **Empty States:** Review theme adherence and specific elements like border radius.
    *   **Error Messages:** Assess visual consistency.
    *   **Success Confirmations:** Assess visual consistency.

## III. Reporting (To Be Done)
1.  **Identify Inconsistencies & Deviations:** Compile a clear list of all observed deviations from `constants/theme.ts` and brand guidelines.
2.  **Provide Prioritized List of Improvements:**
    *   Categorize improvements (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low priority).
    *   Suggest actionable steps for each improvement.
    *   Prioritize based on impact on user experience, brand consistency, and development maintainability.
3.  **Submit Findings:** Use `attempt_completion` to deliver the full review document.
